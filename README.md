Dotnet Core API Starter with Custom JWT auth, user claims and db project

This is my starter kit I'm using with dotnet core with a simple auth. I've mostly used owin/katana in asp.net classic before,
so this is my new template in dotnet core.

This provides the user table VS database project and ability to get and add users with an admin and roles. Note there is no ORM,
just a very light helper layer.

This auth makes it very simple and light rather than use Identity Server 4 or a 3rd party.

Some parts are taken from a great example by
